# CMPE140
My lecture notes for the CMPE 140 (Introduction to Programming for Economics and Management) course at Boğaziçi University. The course uses the R language and the notes are in Jupyter Notebook format.

You can download this repository and run the notebooks on your computer, or you can on the file links above to view them in GitHub.
