Break-even point refers to the point where the costs (fixed plus variable) of a company equals its revenues. After the break-even point, a company starts to make a profit. \n\nFixed cost refers to costs that do not depend on the number of units produced such as rent, utilities etc. whereas variable costs are the costs proportional to the amount of production such as raw material costs.\n\nYour function should take three inputs:\n\n- fixed cost\n- variable cost\n- price per unit\n\nCalculate the break-even point of a company whose fixed cost is 5000 dollars and variable cost is 1.8 dollars.

Every basketball game has 10 players and after each game, these five statistics are reported for every player: points, rebounds, assists, fouls and steals.\n\nNames of the players are as follows: Ali, Kerem, Serhat, Kaan, Mustafa, Bekir, Bilal, Buğra, Mehmet and Fehim.\n\nFor the statistics, we will once more resort to random number generation. However, since these statistics have to be integers, we will use Poisson distribution. \n\nFor generating samples from a Poisson distribution, we will use the **rpois()** function. Since Poisson distribution has only one parameter, this function takes only two inputs: sample size and lambda.\n\nSet the seed to 123.\n\n- For points, create a sample of size 10 from a Poisson distribution with lambda = 15 and assign it to a vector called **points**.\n- For rebounds, create a sample of size 10 from a Poisson distribution with lambda = 6  and assign it to a vector called **rebounds**.\n- For assists, create a sample of size 10 from a Poisson distribution with lambda = 8 and assign it to a vector called **assists**.\n- For fouls, create a sample of size 10 from a Poisson distribution with lambda = 3 and assign it to a vector called **fouls**.\n- For steals, create a sample of size 10 from a Poisson distribution with lambda = 2 and assign it to a vector called **steals**.\n\n```r\n> points\n [1] 12 19  8 15 21 16 10  8 19 16\n```\n\nYour function **basketball** will take 6 inputs: points, rebounds, assists, fouls, steals and player names.
