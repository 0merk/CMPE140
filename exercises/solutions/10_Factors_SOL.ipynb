    "Burcu likes creating plots in R a lot, but she is too lazy to think about what kind of plot to use or to convert categorical variables to factors. She would be much happier if there was a function that does all this job for her. So you decide to create a useful function as a gift to her.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a function called **lazy_plot** with 4 arguments: **x_val**, **y_val**, **x_num** and **y_num**:\n",
    "    - **x_val** and **y_val** represent the x and y values of the data to be plotted.\n",
    "    - **x_num** and **y_num** arguments take logical values indicating whether **x_val** and **y_val** should be treated as numerical or categorical variables. Their default value is True (meaning numerical).\n",
    "    \n",
